// Stirling's formula:
// fact(i) =  i * ln(i) - i + 0.5 * ln(2PIi)
// fact'(i) = ln(i) + 0.5/i

// Definition of F(i, k):
// F(i, k) = e(i) -> I ~ GOORB(n, k) , but it's generalized for real non-negative values of k

// F(i, k) and It's derivative by respect k in this problem the i is given:
// F(i, k) =  (k - i) * ln(n - 1) - (k - 1) * ln(n) + fact(k) - fact(i) - fact(k - i)

// d(F(i, k))/dk = ln(n - 1) - ln(n) + d(fact(k))/dk - d(fact(k - i))/dk
// d(F(i, k))/dk = ln(n - 1) - ln(n) + ln(k) + 0.5/k - ln(k - i) + 0.5/(k - i)

// d2(F(i, k))/(dk)^2 = 1/k - 1 / (k - i) - 0.5 / (k * k) - 0.5 / ((k - i) * (k - i)) < 0  (for any k > i)

//   In range (i, inf] d(F(i, k))/dk is strictly decreasing because d2(F(i, k))/(dk)^2 is negative in all of this range
// so F(i, k) just has one 1 extermom


// Solution: At first we need know what is the pick of F(i, k) if the i is constant
// since the graph has exactly 1 local maximum the answer is bigger than pick. And
// it will be done by 2 binary searches consider to the approximated graph shape.
